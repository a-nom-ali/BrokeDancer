# AUTO PROFILE - Automatic Selection Based on Balance
# ==============================================================================
# This configuration uses automatic profile selection based on your account balance.
# The bot will fetch your balance and select the optimal profile tier automatically.
#
# Profile Selection Logic:
#   - $100-$200:   Learning profile (3.0% spread, 5 shares, conservative)
#   - $200-$500:   Testing profile (2.5% spread, 10 shares, moderate)
#   - $500-$2,000: Scaling profile (2.0% spread, 25 shares, balanced)
#   - $2,000-$5,000: Advanced profile (1.5% spread, 50 shares, aggressive)
#   - $5,000+:     Professional profile (1.0% spread, 100 shares, maximum)
#
# RECOMMENDED: Use auto selection unless you want to override specific parameters.
