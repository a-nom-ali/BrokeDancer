#
# Cross-Platform Arbitrage (Kalshi + Polymarket):
# - $40M+ documented opportunity in 2024-2025
# - Top 3 wallets earned $4.2M+
# - Typical spread: 1-5% on same events
# - Kalshi is US-regulated, Polymarket is not
# - Price differences due to different user bases
#
# Market Matching:
# - Same event MUST exist on both platforms
# - Verify event descriptions match exactly
# - Check resolution criteria are identical
# - Monitor close times (may differ)
#
# Regulatory Differences:
# - Kalshi: CFTC-regulated, KYC required, US-only
# - Polymarket: No KYC, global access, crypto-based
# - This creates persistent arbitrage opportunities
#
# Strategy Execution:
# 1. Find same event on both platforms
# 2. Check price difference (accounting for fees)
# 3. Buy low on one platform, sell high on other
# 4. Hold until resolution or close positions early
# 5. Profit from price convergence or resolution
#
# Best Markets for Arbitrage:

# - Clear resolution criteria
#
# Risk Factors:
# - Resolution disagreement (different outcomes)
# - Liquidity imbalance (can't exit)
# - Fee calculations (eat into profits)
# - Time to resolution (capital locked)
# - Event cancellation or delay
